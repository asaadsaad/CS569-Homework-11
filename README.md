### Angular Application - UI
* Create an Angular application to support the backend code for Homework 12 and Homework 13.  
* Your app must have a public `signup` and `signin` pages, along with a lazy-loaded module `CarsModule` which allow users to Add/Update/Remove cars and rentals.  
* Take into consideration checking for user roles. 
* Use any state management solution to maintain the user state.
* If you have time, replace your native elements with Angular Material components.
